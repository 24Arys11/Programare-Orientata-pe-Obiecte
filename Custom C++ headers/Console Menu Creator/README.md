# Console Menu Creator

console_menu_generator.h is the header file that allows you to easily create beautifull menus in console. If you include it into your cpp file and you may use the Menu class.

(!) ATENTION ! console_menu_generator.h uses certain typedefs and safety comparrison functions from generic_conventions.h. You might find usefull "generic_conventions.h" alltogether since it may help you write safe code in your own project. You need to download generic_conventions.h as well in order for console_menu_generator.h to work, or modify console_menu_generator.h.

example_menu.h just uses the header file to implement a fictive menu to show how neat and easy it is.

main.cpp has only 11 lines (including the empty ones) just to run example_menu.h

a.exe is just "g++ main.cpp"
